    Artistic and functional movement has been at the heart of my journey since childhood—
    beginning in a cramped living room at age five, where I first discovered the joy of dance.
    What started as playful exploration grew into a lifelong passion, carrying me across
    continents and through more than 17 distinct dance styles over the course of 12+ years.
    Along the way, I’ve been privileged to study, perform, compete, and collaborate with artists,
    teachers, and communities in over 15 countries—experiences that deepened my belief in movement
    as a universal language that bridges cultures and transforms lives.

    With a degree in Dance and certifications as a Personal Trainer, I have devoted my career to
    exploring the intersection of artistry and athleticism. My training spans not only traditional
    dance and performance, but also movement practices such as Dance Movement Therapy, Yoga, and
    Zumba, alongside fitness disciplines including strength and conditioning, cardio, flexibility,
    and functional training. This wide-reaching foundation has allowed me to develop a holistic,
    integrative approach—one that celebrates curiosity, supports growth at every level, and helps
    individuals unlock both their artistry and their physical potential.

    My work today bridges both worlds: building functional movement practices for dancers, guiding
    clients toward confidence and strength, and continuing to create through social dance,
    choreography, and competition. Whether in a private session, a group class, or on stage, my goal
    is always the same: to hold space for growth, to celebrate effort, and to guide people toward a
    deeper connection with their bodies and their movement.

  <p>
    From collaborating with global brands to mentoring emerging talent and performing at world
    festivals, I bring both breadth of experience and a grounded vision—one that blends grace with
    grit, structure with creativity, and discipline with play. Above all, I believe movement is for
    everyone: the athlete, the artist, the parent, the teen, the beginner, and the professional
    alike. Wherever you are in your journey, I will meet you there—and move with you forward.
